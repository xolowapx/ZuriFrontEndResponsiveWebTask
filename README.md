# ZuriFrontEndResponsiveWebTask
For the Zuri i4g development training
This task actually involves cloning an already existing webpage created by @emmypuch and then making the webpage responsive with the usee of media queries on Css.
hence, I have opted to extract the files first to an offline editor, edited it offline and then upload the codes back to this repository.
Since there is a pre-existing stylesheet, I simply edited it by inputting different media queries for the various elements I intend to adjust
